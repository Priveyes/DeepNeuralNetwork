# DeepNeuralNetwork
Deep neural network implemented in Java from scratch, without using library/framework.

Features:
* Muli-layer network, the number of layers is configurable.
* Binary classification.
* RELU as activation function for hidden layers and Sigmoid for output layer.
* Vectorized implementation.
* L2 regularization.
* Gradient descent with mini-batches.

Examples:
* ExampleMnistBinaryClassifier: distinguish between 0s and 1s digit images from Mnist

This implementation uses Matrix2 class to perform linear algebra operations. That class was design for academic purposes and it's not optimized in any way.
